MSDataFileReader Change Log

Version 1.2.2355; June 13, 2006
	- Now checking for a corrupted index at the end of an mzXML file

Version 1.2.2330; May 19, 2006
	- Added functions GetSpectrumHeaderInfoByIndex() and GetSpectrumHeaderInfoByScanNumber() to clsMSDataFileAccessorBaseClass
		- These functions are faster than GetSpectrumByScanNumber() and GetSpectrumByIndex() since they do not parse the base-64 encoded MS and Intensity array data

Version 1.2.2326; May 15, 2006
	- Added support for indexing the spectra location in files, which allows for random access to spectra
		- Use class clsMzDataFileAccessor or clsMzXMLFileAccessor for this 
		- Class supports UTF8, UTF-16 Unicode, and Big Endian Unicode, in addition to Ascii files
		- Supports files with either CRLF (Windows) or just LF (Unix) line termination symbols
		- Using a redesigned clsBinaryTextReader that can read forward or backward
	- Added support for reading and using the byte offset index at the end of the mzXml file, if present
	- Now validating the mzXML version listed in the <mzXML> element at the start of the file
		- Currently support mzXML version 2.x (normally 2.0 or 2.1)
		- Set ParseFilesWithUnknownVersion to True to parse files with unknown/unsupported versions
	- Now validating the mzData version listed in the <mzData> element at the start of the file
		- Currently support mzData version 1.x (normally 1.05)
